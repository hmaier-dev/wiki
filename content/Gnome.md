# System-Tray 

By default Gnome 45 does not provide a build in system-tray, where
application like steam, can display their tray icon. The people from
ubuntu provide a solution to this, with the
`gnome-shell-extension-appindicator`. It can be found in the AUR under
[gnome-shell-extension-appindicator-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator-git).

# Changing the default terminal emulator 

You can do this, with the following command:

    sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator
