= Dualbooting with Windows =
With `systemd-boot` it is relativly easy to install Linux and Windows alongside. 
My suggestion would be to install Linux first and then make space for the Windows install. 
`systemd-boot` will automatically find all UEFI-partitions to boot from.

Over the time, problems can occure because Windows will do ugly things to foreign partitions, when it updates.
So be prepared.
== `Error Preparing initrd: Volume corrupted` ==
The Windows install will probably still boot. 
1. Boot with a live medium.
2. Make a filesystem-check on the boot partition and approve the fix-prompt with: `fsck /dev/sda1` 
3. Re-generate the boot-image with: `mkinitcpio -P`
4. Reboot.

= `pacman` =
To ignore updates/replacement for a package, you can add it under options, e.g.:
{{{bash
[options]
IgnorePkg = ttf-sourcecodepro-nerd
}}}
I already have `nerd-fonts-source-code-pro` installed via the AUR, so I ignore the native arch-package.
